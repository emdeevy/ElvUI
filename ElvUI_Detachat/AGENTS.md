# Detachat Coding Guidance

## Commenting level
- Target a 60/100 comment density: more than typical, less than line-by-line.
- Keep comments high-signal and short; explain intent, tricky logic, and API assumptions.
- If you're unsure whether a comment helps, add it.
- Avoid noisy comments that restate obvious code.
